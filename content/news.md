- This time we plan to start Git and GitHub from the web interface and only later
  move to the command line.
- Week 1 is tuned for exercises and group work. Week 2 will focus on
  demonstrations and discussions.
- We offer the two workshop weeks as two blocks but you can sign up for both or just one.
