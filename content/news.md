### News

The course part is done but we offer two "bring your own code" sessions, where
you can bring the exercises or real projects and get live advice. See
schedule.

Material (linked in schedule below), [the Q&A](@/questions/_index.md), and the
[recordings](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLpLblYHCzJADIsbUhXSrC0qW5wDsH-F9U)
will remain available indefinitely.
