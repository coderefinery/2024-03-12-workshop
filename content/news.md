### News



- We covered the things listed in the schedule: three exercises
- Next week we change track.  We give live examples, with less exercises.
  - This is because the exercises are harder to do in big groups
  - You will have time and we encourage you to try exercises yourself after the course
- Week 2 preparation
  - Anyone can come, installation of software isn't needed, since things are designed as demos.

- We have simplified the install instructions: <https://coderefinery.github.io/installation/>
- Week 1 is tuned for exercises and group work. Week 2 will focus on
  demonstrations and discussions.
