### News

News for day 5:
- We covered documentation and Jupyter, as expected.
- Tomorrow is our last day, and really wraps everything up
  - Testing: putting all the git and github things together to see how to have checks to improve your code.  It's very useful
  - Modular code dev: An exciting live-coding section, we start with a
    basic plot in Jupyter and show how we make it more and more
    modular until it's a reusable program.  Don't miss it, and tell
    all your friends!
- Don't forget "bring your own code" sessions, where you can bring the
  exercises or real projects and get live advice. See schedule.
