### News



- News for day 2:

  - We did the things that are now listed on the schedule
  - Tomorrow is "git collaborative".
    - It builds on things today - it would be good to review if you haven't attended days 1-2.
    - We assume that you can link to and push/pull from GitHub. You need to make sure the authentication works with whatever program you are using: https://coderefinery.github.io/installation/ssh/
    - It is possible to do everything in GitHub though.

- We have simplified the install instructions: <https://coderefinery.github.io/installation/>
- Week 1 is tuned for exercises and group work. Week 2 will focus on
  demonstrations and discussions.
