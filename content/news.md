### News

- We covered the things mentioned in the schedule (Reproducible
  Research and Social Coding)
- It was all demo-based, no exercises
- There are many good questions and answered in the Notes, available on the website. Check it out!
- There is nothing to prepare for days 5-6 since it is also demo
  - But if you do, you will be able to try yourself after the
    course. There is plenty to actually try.
-  Remember, the "why" is more important than the "how" - we cover the "why" and link to the "how".

Older news:

- During the second workshop week we focus on live examples and discussions
  (exercises are harder to do in big groups).
- Anyone can come, installation of software isn't needed, since things are designed as demos.
- If you have the time, we encourage you to try exercises yourself after the course
