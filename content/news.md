### News

- Day 1 news
  - We covered the lessons
    [Browsing](https://coderefinery.github.io/git-intro/browsing/)
    [Committing](https://coderefinery.github.io/git-intro/commits/),
    and [Merging](https://coderefinery.github.io/git-intro/merging/).
    You should review these if you missed day 1 - the exercises and
    solutions are all built-in there.
  - Day 1 was about learning concepts the easy way (web).  Day 2 goes
    to local work and is real examples of working on your own
    projects: you'll see how we really do it.
  - It's OK to come day 2 if you haven't come day 1.  Invite your
    friends!  Do check the preparation though.
  - For day 2, we'll move to local work.  It's important that you have
    your local VS Code or command line terminal set up to follow
    (though many parts can also be done through the GitHub web
    interface still).  See the install instructions.
- We have simplified the install instructions: <https://coderefinery.github.io/installation/>
- This time we plan to start Git and GitHub from the web interface and only later
  move to the command line.
- Week 1 is tuned for exercises and group work. Week 2 will focus on
  demonstrations and discussions.
- We offer the two workshop weeks as two blocks but you can sign up for both or just one.
