## List of exercises

### Week 1

Week 1 will be a mix of discussions and exercises (on your own or in teams).

We are updating exercises and will post here a new list as soon as we are done.


### Week 2

In week 2, the instructors will go through exercises on stream and invite
learners to participate with questions using the collaborative document.

We will not switch between lectures and group exercise sessions in week 2.  For
groups that wish to go through exercises on their own, we recommend to schedule
separate sessions for this.
