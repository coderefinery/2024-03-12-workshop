Dear <name>,

Thank you for joining the workshop this week, and for all the wonderful questions we got from you and hopefully could answer sufficiently in our collaborative document.

All these questions and answers from this week are archived at https://coderefinery.github.io/2024-03-12-workshop/questions/

Video recordings are up on youtube: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9eUUd40HkYI&list=PLpLblYHCzJADIsbUhXSrC0qW5wDsH-F9U

We hope you got some good practice and understanding on how to collaborate using Git/GitHub and our trial of collaborating with you from the stream worked out for you! 
If you have suggestions on how to improve our lessons, please open issues or send pull requests: https://github.com/coderefinery


Next week will be a little more diverse!

We will take a peek into six topics that are all related to FAIR research software development:

Tuesday will start with an overview of how all CodeRefinery lessons fit together under the umbrella of reproducible research 
and what steps you can take now already to make your research more reproducible. In the afternoon we will look into licenses, 
how they work and why you might want to care even when "only writing a small script for myself".

Wednesday morning we look at different ways of how to document research code. From small projects with good README files to 
external documentation on Read the Docs. In the afternoon we will show some tips and tricks around Jupyter notebooks and how they can be used also outside of courses.

Thursday we step a little deeper into software development practices by giving you a peek into automated testing and how this could benefit you and your collaborators. 
The workshop ends with some live coding to showcase how to make code more reusable by caring about modularity.

In contrast to week 1, there will not be any dedicated exercise times in week 2. Instead, instructors will demo things and discuss with you using the collaborative document.
If you want, you can of course try to follow the demos or try to do them on your own time after the workshop. For this, you will need to install some tools which you can find at 
https://coderefinery.github.io/installation/. 

We hope to see you again in any of our sessions of week 2!

CodeRefinery team
