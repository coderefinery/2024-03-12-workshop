Dear {first_name},

thank you so much for participating! Special thanks to all the exercise leaders, local organizers, volunteers, helpers, instructors, and organizers.

Please let us know how this workshop went for you. Please give us honest feedback about what went well and what didn't go so well. Either by replying to me or by writing to support@coderefinery.org.

We recognize that applying all these tools and techniques is not easy. Don't try to do things perfectly, try to do thing better. Ask for help and work together.

We provide two "bring your own code" sessions. Please come and discuss with us:
